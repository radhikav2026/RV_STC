"""Lightweight state machine helper.

Used by risk register, workflow tasks, regulatory-ops submissions, and any
other lifecycle-bearing record that needs transition logging. Intentionally
tiny: a transitions table + a record base class that captures every change.

Example::

    class RiskState(str, Enum):
        IDENTIFIED = "identified"
        ASSESSED = "assessed"
        CLOSED = "closed"

    TRANSITIONS = {
        RiskState.IDENTIFIED: {RiskState.ASSESSED},
        RiskState.ASSESSED: {RiskState.CLOSED},
        RiskState.CLOSED: set(),
    }

    record = StatefulRecord(state=RiskState.IDENTIFIED)
    record.transition(RiskState.ASSESSED, TRANSITIONS, actor="riskops", reason="...")
