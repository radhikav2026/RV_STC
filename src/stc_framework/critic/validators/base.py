"""Base types for Critic validators.

What a validator is
-------------------
A validator is an async callable that inspects a request or response
and emits a :class:`GuardrailResult`. The Critic's :class:`RailRunner`
looks up validators by ``rail_name`` (a class attribute, not an init
arg) and runs them in parallel under a bulkhead + timeout.

The ``rail_name`` class attribute is the **stable identifier** that
the declarative spec references under ``critic.guardrails.*_rails[*].name``.
It MUST NOT be a constructor argument — that would let two instances
claim to be the same rail, and would decouple the spec's identifier
from the class's identity. Renaming the class attribute is a
spec-breaking change.

What to set on ``GuardrailResult``
----------------------------------
- ``passed`` — True if the response is acceptable.
- ``severity`` — ``"critical"`` causes the Critic to block; ``"high"``
  causes a warn; ``"low"`` is informational only.
- ``action`` — the recommended disposition (``"pass"``, ``"warn"``,
  ``"block"``, ``"redact"``). Advisory; the Critic aggregates and
  picks the final action based on severity.
- ``details`` — a short human-readable explanation. Goes into audit
  but not into the caller-facing response (the caller only sees rail
  names).
- ``evidence`` — a structured dict for auditor review. Put matched
  pattern names, numeric values, grounding scores here. Do NOT put
  raw user content (that would leak PII into audit).

Adding a new validator
----------------------
See :file:`CONTRIBUTING.md` → Recipe 1 (Add a Critic rail) for the
full checklist. The short version:

1. Subclass :class:`Validator`, set ``rail_name`` and ``severity`` as
   class attributes.
2. Implement ``async def avalidate(self, ctx)``.
3. Register the instance in :class:`stc_framework.critic.critic.Critic`
   under the same string key as the spec's ``name:`` field.
4. Declare the rail in the spec YAML.
5. Write a regression test under ``tests/unit/test_<name>_validator.py``.
